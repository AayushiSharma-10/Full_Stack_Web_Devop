            <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
            <p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
            <p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
            <p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
            <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
            <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
            <p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
            <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
            <p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
            <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
